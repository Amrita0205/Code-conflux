              This year, we are proud to introduce{" "}
              <strong className="text-purple-400">Code Conflux</strong>,
              IIITR&apos;s very own hackathon. What began as a vision has now
              transformed into an inspiring reality. This initiative is designed
              to unite the entire college community for a day of programming,
              offering participants an unparalleled opportunity to explore their
              interests in technology and innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The success of this event will not only pave the way for similar
              impactful initiatives but also strengthen the coding culture
              within our institution. Furthermore, it will facilitate
              connections with other Institutes of National Importance (INIs)
              through inter- and intra-institutional competitions, fostering
              collaboration and shared growth.
